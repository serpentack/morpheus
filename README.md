_**Morpheus**_ is a tool used to enable features bound to the Redpill feature lockout system and its four lockdown tiers on compatible Windows 8 development builds compiled between Milestone 1 up through Milestone 3/Developer Preview, in addition to a limited number of Consumer Preview builds (up to ~8123).

Unlike other previous approaches made to enable Redpill features, Morpheus leverages the pre-existing Redpill license tokens sourced from the Windows 8 Developer Preview (`WINMAIN_WIN8M3` 8102.101); its approach does not disable the Software Protection Platform (SPP), the Windows service responsible for managing the operating system's activation state.

## Usage
Run Morpheus on a Windows 8 build with production-signed SPP certificate chains. You can determine whether a build is using production signing by checking whether the SPP Trusted Store directory (`Windows\System32\spp\store`) exists in the OS installation. Builds with test-signed certificate chains are easily distinguished from production-signed chains if the SPP store directory has the `_test` suffix in its name; Morpheus will not run if this is the case.

Morpheus supports Windows 8 builds 7779 through 8123, through your mileage may vary between different milestones. Morpheus will refuse to run on Windows 8 builds that have code paths for the Metro UX stripped out, in particular:
* `WINMAIN` 8020 x86/amd64
* `FBL_EEAP` builds 8049 and later
* Any `WINMAIN_WIN8M3_EEAP` build

For best results, use Redpill lockdown tier 1 and just add water.

## Credits
Kudos to the following for their tools and help:
* gus33000 and casm for making Redlock, the tool used to drop in the Redpill payload
* The folks at MAS for developing [TSForge](https://github.com/massgravel/TSForge)
	* Special thanks to @WitherOrNot for assisting in debugging an astoundingly stupid SPP bug that prevented the other three Redpill licensing tiers from activating
* NirSoft for their AdvancedRun tool (used to elevate Redlock to the `TrustedInstaller` account)
